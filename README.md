## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### Physics Foundations
The force is only applied perpendicular to the plane of collision, so the tangential velocity remains unchanged (no force = no acceleration)
#### 1. Conservation of Momentum and Impulse
```math
m_1\vec{v}_1 + m_2\vec{v}_2 = m_1\vec{v}_1' + m_2\vec{v}_2'
```
The unit vector in the normal direction of the collision is:
```math
\hat{n} = \dfrac{\vec{r_2}-\vec{r_1}}{||\vec{r_2}-\vec{r_1}||}
```
Where r1 and r2 are the position vectors of each particle. Then, by the Impulse-Momentum theorem:
```math
J = J_1 = - J_2 = \lambda \hat{n}
```
```math
\Rightarrow \vec{p'_1} - \vec{p_1} = J_1 = \lambda \hat{n}
```
```math
\vec{p'_2} - \vec{p_2} = J_2 = -\lambda \hat{n}
```

#### 2. Coefficient of Restitution
```math
e = \dfrac{v'_{1n}-v'_{2n}}{v_{1n}-v_{2n}}
```

Combining all these equations one can solve for the:

### 3. Equations of Final Velocities
```math
\vec{v'_1} = \vec{v_1} + \dfrac{m_2}{m_1+m_2}(e+1)((\vec{v_2}-\vec{v_1})\cdot \hat{n})\hat{n}
```

```math
\vec{v'_2} = \vec{v_2} - \dfrac{m_1}{m_1+m_2}(e+1)((\vec{v_2}-\vec{v_1})\cdot \hat{n})\hat{n}
```
Please observe that when e = 1 (elastic collision), you arrive at the well known equations for the final velocites after an elastic collision
